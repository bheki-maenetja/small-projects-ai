    "### 6) _Flood fill_ algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first part, you are going to implement the **Flood fill** algorithm. It is a very basic algorithm with a lot of uses. For instance, as we will see later, it is in fact used in most \"paint\" programs, specifically, when you use a \"bucket\" tool and click somewhere on an image, to have all the neighbouring pixels with the same value be filled with a chosen colour. Technically, it involves assigning a value to all the \"connected\" elements of a given element in a matrix (as elaborated below).\n",
    "\n",
    "We start pouring \"water\" on an *initial* pixel (or cell), which is just an element of a matrix. The \"water\" will only \"flow\" to all neighbouring cells with the exact same value (let's called it `v`). This value can represents anything like intensity, colour, etc. Neighbours of an element are all the elements in the matrix that are immediately above, below, right or left of it. *The water stops flowing only when for each pixel with value `v`, there exists no other neighbours with the same value*.  Once the \"flooding\" stops, we can give a new colour to all flooded cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q. Fill in the gap below and write a function that takes as input: a numpy array, the coordinates of the initial point, and the value that should be given to all the flooded cells. Your function should return a new numpy array with the updated values.**\n",
    "\n",
